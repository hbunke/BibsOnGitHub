Library Institutions and People on GitHub
=========================================

A rapidly increasing number of libraries, librarians, and developers of
library software do have an account on GitHub and publish their work as open
source. [This list](list.md) wants to present an (incomplete) overview of these
accounts. It started focused on Germany, but is now open for any institution or
person, mainly from Europe. There's already a similar collection in the
[Code4LibWiki](http://wiki.code4lib.org/Libraries_Sharing_Code), that focuses
on the US.

This is a collaborative project. Additions and suggestions are very welcome.
Feel free to submit a Pull Request. If you have any questions or suggestions,
please file an [Issue](https://github.com/hbunke/BibsOnGitHub/issues).


Hints
-----

-   Please enter the GitHub URLs with the default markdown syntax.
    For the representation on GitHub the simple URL would be sufficient, but
    in the future the list could also be used for other display and conversion
    purposes. If you like, you can run the included small script (links.py),
    which converts simple URLs in the `list.md` file into Markdown syntax (the
    URL must be on a separate line):
        python links.py

-   If adding persons please also give their institutional affiliation. Persons are sorted by their name.
